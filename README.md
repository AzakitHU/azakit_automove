# Dynamically adjusts player speed based on weather and health.
The AutoMove script enhances player immersion by dynamically adjusting movement based on environmental conditions like rain, snow, and health status.

Easy configuration:
* Rain-Triggered Jogging: Reduces running speed to a slow jog in heavy rain, promoting cautious movement on slippery surfaces.
* Snow-Triggered Jogging: Similar to rain, it reduces running speed to a slow jog during snowfall, encouraging careful navigation on snowy terrain.
* Injury-Based Limping: Applies a limping animation when health falls below 50%, limiting movement speed until health improves.
* Visual Effects for Injuries: Introduces a blurring effect to simulate impaired vision during injuries, adding realism to gameplay.
* Automatic Control: Seamlessly transitions between running, jogging, and limping states based on current conditions.

The AutoMove script enriches gameplay by integrating environmental challenges and health impacts.
